# LinkedIn Automation Bot - UiPath  

Welcome to the **LinkedIn Automation Bot** project! This repository showcases a robotic process automation (RPA) solution built with **UiPath** to streamline and automate LinkedIn connection requests.  

---

## Overview  
The LinkedIn Automation Bot is designed to:
1. Open LinkedIn and perform a search for **technical recruiters**.
2. Filter the search results to focus on **Berlin, Germany**.
3. Automate the process of sending **connection requests** to recruiters in the search results.
4. Skip any profiles where the **"Message"** or **"Follow"** options are displayed.
5. Click only on profiles where the **"Connect"** button is available.

## Features
- **Automation Tool:** Built using the **UiPath** RPA platform.  
- **Search Target:** Focuses on technical recruiters in a specific location (**Berlin, Germany**).  
- **Selective Connection Requests:** Ensures only connection requests are sent by identifying the "Connect" button.  
- **Efficient Navigation:** Skips profiles with "Message" or "Follow" options, enhancing efficiency.

## Prerequisites
- UiPath Studio installed on your system.

## Limitations
